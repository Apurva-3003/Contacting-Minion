# Contacting_Minion
This is an app I created for my 7 year old brother who loves minions. I thought a platform where he can tune in and listen to how minions speak might be fun for him, and ofcourse, he LOVED it! :-)

# Special Features
As I developed this app with my brother in mind, I wanted to make it as easy for him to use as possible. So, I gave this app many special features that I normally don't use.
- Instead of typing to give data to the program, I embedded a microphone. Now all the user needs to is speak into the device and the data will be recorded with great accuracy.
- Next, I used the funtranslation API in order to translate user data into minion-tongue.
- Finally, once the data has been translated sans error, the translation will be displayed on the screen.
- If the user wants to hear the minion speak the translated dialogue, there is also a button to do so

(On a side not, the app bar displays the approximate accuracy by which the user's speech has been recorded)
